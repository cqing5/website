## Teaching at Stanford

One of my favorite parts of my Stanford experience was being a Course Assistant for SYMSYS 1: Minds and Machines, taught by Dr. Noah Goodman and Dr. Jiajun Wu, for four quarters (I could probably recite all of my presentations in my sleep by now😅). Due to the course's flipped classroom structure, most of students' learning occurred in our weekly discussion sections, where I prioritized creating an engaging and inclusive learning environment Importantly, this role gave me the opportunity to make advanced topics like AI and neural networks accessible to students from diverse academic and personal backgrounds. I also had the opportunity to CA the course for Stanford Summer Session, where I got to teach high schoolers for the first time—a daunting, yet highly rewarding, endeavor.

## Teaching at IU
### Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Courses
At IU, I was an Associate Instructor for two foundational HCI courses. In Spring 2022, I taught INFO-I 246: Use and Usability with Dr. Phil Jordan, and in Fall 2021, I taught INFO-I 300: HCI/Design with Dr. Katie Siek. Both roles allowed me to mentor and guide studios of 20-30 students through various stages of the design process. From conducting primary and secondary user research to conceptualizing designs and usability testing, I helped students develop their skills in wireframing and prototyping using tools like Figma and Adobe XD. This was an incredible opportunity to help foster students'  design thinking, user research skills, ability to navigate usability challenges, and creativity in developing user-centered solutions.

### Psychology Courses
In addition to HCI courses, I also TA'd for several psychology courses, ranging from large introductory courses to advanced capstone courses:
* PSY-P 304: Social Psychology with Dr. Dorainne Green (Spring 2022)
* PSY-P 101: Introductory Psychology with Dr. Timothy Patrick (Fall 2021)
* PSY-P 421: Laboratory in Social Psychology with Dr. Timothy Patrick (Fall 2020 – Spring 2021)
* PSY-P 325: Psychology of Learning with Dr. Timothy Patrick (Spring 2020)

 While each course had its unique aspects, one of my favorite experiences was TAing the capstone course, PSY-P 421. In this course, I guided students through the research process, from refining their research questions to designing their studies and conducting their analyses. I loved helping students develop their own independent research projects and getting to combine my passion for research and teaching.
